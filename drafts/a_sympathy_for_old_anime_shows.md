# A sympathy for old anime shows

I am not a weeb, nor do I watched anime a lot, but I always have more of a sympathy towards old anime shows (from the 80s and 90s) than new anime shows. I think that old anime shows just has a sort of charm and nostalgia, where shows were made to be enjoyed, and not creating a hentai addiction to the viewer.
