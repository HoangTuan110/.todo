# Try Twitter Threads

Recently, I have been exprimenting with transforming my blog posts into Twitter threads, instead of just simply tweet a link to the blog post.

This is because I read an [article](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/how-to-get-more-followers-on-twitter/) ([archive](https://archive.is/aNUXv)) about how to gain Twitter followers, and one of the tactics they mentioned is using threads.

The Twitter threads perform surprisingly well, gaining each link a minimum of 8 clicks, compared to 5 or less with just tweet a link.

The number of clicks in general also grow up, from 10-20 clicks to now 30-40 clicks consistently.

This seems to go really well, and I will experiment this with more of my blog posts in the future.

The bottom line? If you have a Twitter account, big or small, try using threads. It is a great way to engage with your audience and get more traffic.
