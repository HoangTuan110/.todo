# An Unorganized Life

Today I realized I have been living (what I considered) an unorganized life: Instead of starting the day knowing what I want to achieve today, I wake up completely blind and directionless, and let my brain do whatever it wants to drive me into.

I think this is the reason why I procrastinated so much: When my brains are empty and have nothing to do, it just wants that instant gratification.

Because of that, I decided that tonight (at my place), I will be listing a list of stuff that I want to do tonight, and trying to do them. Wish me luck!
