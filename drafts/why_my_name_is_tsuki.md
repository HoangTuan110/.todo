# Why my name is `Tsuki`

<center>
If you have visited this blog (either the first time or a fan of mine), you probably know me as `Tsuki`. But you may ask why did I choose this name.

Well, a few months ago, I was playing a game called `Tsukis Odyssey`. It's a mobile game made by HyperBeard (same team that made Adorable Home BTW). The story is that you are a rabbit named `Tsuki` and when you're going to your hometown, all the stuff in your home were stolen by a raccoon because of your dumb giraffe friend, and you have to start all over again.

Did I choose the name because of the gameplay? No. The game is boring as shit. What made me chose it is that in the game there's a field where you plant fruits and stuff. Whenever the crop is ready to harvest, the game alarms you about it with a creepy-looking Tsuki staring at your soul like it's about to kill you if you don't do the harvest.

I was very intrigued and from that, I used `Tsuki` as my nickname online.

> Fun fact: I used to thought that `Tsuki` is some European first name, until I realized that it was a real Japanese word.
