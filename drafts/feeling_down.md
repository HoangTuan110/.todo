# Feeling down

For the past few days since the start of summer, I have been feeling down. Every time I tried to recall what useful/interesting things I have done today, I cannot recall anything. At the middle of the day, instead of getting a good sleep and feel energized for afternoon, I watched YouTube all time, making me feel sick and tired.

I know there's a lots of ups and downs in a person's life, so hopefully after this, I will be able to recover. Also, this tells me that I need to isolate myself from YouTube more and more. I will go to the pool and learn swimming tomorrow, so it will be exciting.
