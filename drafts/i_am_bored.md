# I am bored

Today, I am bored.

I am really, really, bored.

I have nothing in my brain right now, nothing to build, nothing to spend time on.

I am just opening websites and let them hang there for eternity.

I don't know what else to do than to write that I am bored.

As usual, my brain wants me to surf YouTube, but I have blocked it until 10 AM (it's 8 AM at here), so I can't really do it either.

Well, let's open some games.
