# URL Shortener Gift

A cool thing that I learned today is that if you type `https://tinyurl.com/` followed by 5 random characters and numbers, it will redirect you to a random URL, e.g. [https://tinyurl.com/abcde](https://tinyurl.com/abcde). This works with every big URL shortener sites, e.g. [https://is.gd/luci](https://is.gd/luci) or [https://bitly.com/abcde](https://bitly.com/abcde).

Note that the link that you are about to redirect to can be harmful, so make sure to preview it first. With TinyURL, you can add `preview.` before the domain, e.g. `https://preview.tinyurl.com/abcde`. With Bitly, add `+` at the end. The same with `is.gd`, but add `-` to the end instead.

Most of the time, the URL shortener service will explain to you how to preview a shorten URL. But if you can't, then you can use services like [unshorten.it](https://unshorten.it) or [GetLinkInfo](https://www.getlinkinfo.com/) to unshorten the URL.
