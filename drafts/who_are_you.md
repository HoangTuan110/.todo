# Who are you?

A lot of times I wonder the person who is reading my blog behind the screen. Who are they? Where are they from? How do they know me? Hacker News? Bear? Somewhere else? I know this is a lot of questions to ask a stranger, but I am truly curious and I want to know who the heck is reading this. I have a lot of questions and not enough answer.
