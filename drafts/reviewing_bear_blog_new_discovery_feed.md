# Reviewing Bear's new Discovery feed

Bear has completely changed its Discovery feed a few days ago.

Here is what it looks like at the moment:

Here is what it used to look like about a month ago (27 May, 2022):

The first significant change is the removal of `Toast this post` button. This is to fix the [`Double toast`](https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/issues/66) bug, where a post can be toasted (i.e. upvoted) twice. I'm happy that Bear finally fix this.

Another quite significant change is that the section format for each of the blog post has changed from `N toast(s) (W week/days, D days/hours ago)` to `Published W week/days, D days/hours ago - N toast(s)`.

Overall, this is some positive changes for Bear. I hope to see it grow and become more popular.
