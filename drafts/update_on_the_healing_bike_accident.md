# Update on the healing since the bike ride accident

This post will be about some updates on the healing since the [bike ride accident](https://tsk.bearblog.dev/i-hurt-myself/).

If you don't want to read that post, then the TLDR is that 2 days ago, I hurt myself while riding a bike and that left me with a big open wound on my right leg.

I don't mention this in the original, but I also have a smaller, less painful wound on my left hand, which will be important later.

Because of the leg wound, I have to change a lot of my habits. For example, when I'm about to plug the charger for my laptop, I have to place my left leg to the ground instead of my right.

The big wound also makes it harder for me to sit down and stand up when I am having lunch/dinner with my family, since now I have to leverage on something strong.

Similarly, the hand wound also changed a lot of my habit. More specifically, when I am brushing my teeth. When I'm about to clean my face, I now have to use the left hand.

The good side is that now I can walk normally without much pain, and moving the leg is less painful.

Overall, the wound seems to heal fairly fast, but I will have to wait for a few days for it to completely heal.
