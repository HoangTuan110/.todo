# People like to `git clone` a GitHub repo more than to visit the repo first

...is a thing that I noticed today when I published a little programming project called [quicktable](https://github.com/HoangTuan110/quicktable/) and made a Show HN for it. When looking into the traffic graphs, there are 128 clones in 1 day, with 69 unique cloners, but only 1 visitors. Weird.

Here is the `git clone` graph:

And here is the visitor graph:
