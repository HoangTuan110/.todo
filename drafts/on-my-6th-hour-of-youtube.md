# On my 6th hour of YouTube

I recently just got hit with enteritis (probably from food poisoning) so I binged a lot of YouTube videos lately due to not wanting, or having the energy, to do anything. I don't regret this though, as I am just recovering and will come back anytime soon. This doesn't make me feel less bad about watching YouTube for almost the entire day, though.
