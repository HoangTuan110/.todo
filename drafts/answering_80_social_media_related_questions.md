# Answering 80 social media-related questions

Today, I decided to answer 80 social media-related questions, based on a report by [Answer The Public](https://answerthepublic.com/reports/3ffbd37a-0c28-4c1b-bd7a-3dcf36e92bbb).

I will answer each question as brief and concise as possible, since these questions are fairly general. I will also link to articles for additional resources.

Note that I will exclude questions that, I think, are too vague or simply makes no sense, or I can't answer them for whatever reason that I have.
