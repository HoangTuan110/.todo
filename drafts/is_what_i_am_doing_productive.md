# Is what I am doing productive?

This is a question that I keep asking in my mind many times, whether it is me watching YouTube or just doing some SEO shit. I used to think that I am just way to obsessed with productivity and that using social media (moderately) is okay.

But then my mind just keeps asking.

It got to a point where I feel like nothing I do is productive and feeling shamed for trying anything at all.
