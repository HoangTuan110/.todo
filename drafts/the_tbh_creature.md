# The TBH creature

Today I attempted to draw a very small version of the TBH creature[^1] in pixel art for practicing. It looks nothing like the original, and I drawed it in 10 minutes, but it does have some resemblance. The art itself is in 16x16, but I have resized it to 128x128 for better seeing, though this made it look low-quality. I recommend installing the small one if you want the art to be crisp.
