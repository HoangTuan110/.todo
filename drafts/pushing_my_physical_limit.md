# Pushing my physical limit

Since the start of summer, I have had a hobby of riding a bike for a pretty long road.

But today, I broke the limit.

Today I rode from my house to the roundabout near my old English center, which is about a few kilometers.

It was a very tiring ride: There are many times when I have to stop to take energy, my legs were very sore, and I have almost no energy and feel dehydrated by the end of the ride.

But I managed to finish it, and it was so rewarding.

After finishing the ride, I have to drink a lot of water because of dehydration, and I feel dizzy due to sitting for so long.

But that ride has basically proved what my body is physically capable of. And I felt empowered because of it.
