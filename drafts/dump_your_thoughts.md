# Dump your thoughts

When I wrote the blog post [A Thing About Numbers](/a-thing-about-numbers), I was really worried seeing the number of visitors to my site plummeted. So worried in fact, I wrote that post to release my anxiety.

And after finishing it, I feel so fucking relieving.

After that experience, I have learned that dumping whatever you're thinking right now is the best way to deal with anxiety or stress. If you have enough to say, just stop.
