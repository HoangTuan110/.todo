# Using a very old machine

I find weird saying this, but I am using the machine my uncle (who's a architect) gave to me and my brother over a decade ago as my main machine. It's a black and silver [Dell Vostro 3550](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Dell-Vostro-3550-Notebook.53227.0.html), and just to show how old it is, it has a CD drive slot.

Of course, this machine has shown its age over the years. The touchpad barely ever works now. The Intel sticker has lose its text. The Windows 7 sticker is nonexistent. It requires all-time battery charge whenever it is on. And it uses the Intel i3-2310M, which is [very old](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-i3-2310M-Notebook-Processor.45318.0.html).

With a CPU this old, I have got some problems running newer software. One time I am very excited to try [Bun](https://bun.sh), the blazingly fast JS run-time, until I realized that [Bun requires AVX2 to run properly, which my CPU doesn't support](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/252).

However, since switching to Linux, I have been pretty happy with this machine. It's the thing that made me got into Linux and programming. And it's the thing that I used to write this post.
