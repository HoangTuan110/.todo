# Should I start a newsletter?

The question is in the title. I have a feel to start a newsletter since it would allow me to have better connections with my audience and let them see my newest post quicker, but I also feel like that with the very small audience that I have (thanks all the 40 people who are reading this, you guys are awesome!), it may not worth it to get a newsletter, since I will likely to have 0 subscribers and also wasting time repost everything to it.

So, should I start one?
