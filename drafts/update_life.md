# Updating life

Hello there! Sorry to myself for not writing a post a pretty long time.

I have been quite busy recently studying for mid-semester exams, which
is why I haven't wrote a post this week. It has nearly come to an end,
but I still have English and Math left, so hopefully I will be able to
write more frequently after the exam.

Summer is near now, and I can already feel the nostalgia from the burning
sun, the beautiful white of light, and the cooling air of winds.

While waiting for summer, here are things that I have done this week:
- Learning about minimal web tech: [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/).
  Alpine works like a charm, although it can be cumbersome. Sometimes
  you have to debug your data code by including it in `Alpine.data`.
  There's also [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/), but it looks
  like overgrown Alpine to me.
- Using Ruby for web development. Ruby is a language known for making websites,
  but I have never actually used it for anything besides an [esolang](https://github.com/HoangTuan110/arsel).
  So I decided to learn a lot of Ruby-related web things, including:
  - [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) is the most popular web framework in the
  Ruby space. It powers many popular sites, such as GitHub, Twitch and AirBNB.
  My first impressions on Rails is that it looks pretty scary: A whole list of
  directories and Ruby code that I barely understand. It still looks robust, so
  I will try it after the exams.
  - [HAML](https://haml.info) is a template language that compiles to HTML. It is intended
  to be an ERB alternative, with cleaner syntax and sugarcoating. I have been using
  it with Alpine and have a good experience with it. The only downfall of it is nested
  elements (like `%p`) are a bit hard to get used to.
- Building some ordinary web applications.

Now, for the bad news:
For the past couple of days, my grandpa's health has been severely degraded. He now
got COVID-19 and a condition which makes him unable to eat solid food. I am really
worried about him, and it looks like his life has come to an end. I am still hoping
for magic to happen and my grandpa to win the battle.

That's all things that happened in this week. Note to my future self: If my grandpa
win or lose the battle, please write a post about it.
