# Updating life

Hello there! Sorry to myself for not writing a post a pretty long time.

I have been quite busy recently studying for mid-semester exams. It has
come to an end, but I still have English and Math left, so hopefully I
will write more frequently after the exam.

Summer is near now, and I can already feel the nostalgia from the burning
sun, the beautiful white of light, and the cooling air of winds.

While waiting for summer rest, here are some things that I have done
this week:
- Learning about minimal web tech: Alpine. Alpine works like a charm, although
  it can be cumbersome.
- Using Ruby for web development. Ruby is a language known for making websites,
  but I have never actually used it for anything besides an esolang. So I decided
  to learn a lot of Ruby-related web things, including:
  - Rails is the most popular web framework in the Ruby space. It powers many
  popular sites, such as GitHub, Twitch and AirBNB. My first impressions on Rails
  is that it looks pretty scary: A whole list of files and Ruby code that I don't
  know where to start. It still looks robust, and I will try it after the exams.
  - HAML is a template language that compiles to HTML. It is intended
  to be an ERB alternative, with cleaner syntax and sugarcoating. I have been using
  it with Alpine and have a good experience with it. The only downfall of it is nested
  elements (like `%p`) are a bit hard to get used to.
- Building some ordinary web applications.

So that's things that I have learned in this week. Most of them are Ruby web technologies,
and a lot of them give me a good impression. I will build more interesting web apps next time!
