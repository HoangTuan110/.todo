# Don't have any expectations for your project

A thing that I learned from building a bunch of programming projects is that projects where I have no expectation often does better than projects where I have a good idea of what to expect.

This is because with projects where I have no expectation, I have more freedom to evolve it into whatever I want it to be, and I got to choose where to stop. Whereas with project where I have some, I often get pressured because my mind keeps thinking that I might never finish it.
