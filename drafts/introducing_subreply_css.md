# Introducing Subreply CSS - A beautiful classless CSS style

Recently, I came across this website called [Subreply](https://subreply.com/about), which is an English-only forum with a clean and simplistic design.

When I first saw it, I immediately fall in love with its design: Simple, yet modern and beautiful. I love it so much that I decided to rip the CSS from the website and turn it into a classless CSS style.

And after about 2 days of active working, I introduce to you, Subreply CSS!

Subreply CSS is a classless CSS style that is designed to be modern, beautiful, and simple, just like where it came from.

Features include:

* **Lightweight** - Only weights 4 kB! [^1]
* **Mobile responsive** and **image responsive**
* **Automatic dark/light theme** (based on OS preferences)
* **Custom emojis** before `mailto:`, `sms:`, and `tel:` links
* **Custom blockquotes** and **code blocks** [^2]
* Beautiful font ([Route 159](https://dotcolon.net/font/route159/))
* Fixing missing features from the original Subreply, such as **radios and checkboxes**

Subreply CSS is suitable for both personal blogs and simple websites!

# Wow! That's exciting! Where can I know more about it?

You can go to the [Github repo](https://github.com/HoangTuan110/subreply-css), which contains further information about the project.

# I'm still skeptical, I want to try it first

You can try this [demo](https://raw.githack.com/HoangTuan110/subreply-css/main/test.html) [^3] or just playing around with my website (yes, it uses Subreply CSS).

# Downsides

Even though it has a lot of good points, Subreply CSS also has some downsides:

- All the fonts are currently hosted on [Catbox](https://catbox.moe/), a file hosting service that I am relying on. This means that if Catbox goes down, all the fonts will be rendered unusable. The best solution for this is to host fonts locally, and I am planning on writing a (short) blog post just for that, so stay tuned!
