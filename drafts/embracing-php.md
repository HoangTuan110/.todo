# Embracing PHP

PHP is a pretty special language to me. It is a programming language that I never actually learned and
not wanting to learn because of its notorious reputation. But after reading this [post](https://dnlytras.com/blog/modern-php/)
about new features in PHP and see it more positively, I decided to learn the language and see if all the
bad things that had been assigned with it actually affects my experience.
