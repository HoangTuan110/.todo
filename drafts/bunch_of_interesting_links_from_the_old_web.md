# A bunch of interesting links (from the old web)

After diving into a whole rabbit hole of the old Internet from [this one post](https://nights.bearblog.dev/how-to-stop-being-terminally-online/), I decided to make a list of the most interesting links I found while diving.

Updated: 18/05/2022

Found a grammar mistake or want to add a link to the list? [Email me](mailto:danghoangtuan526@protonmail.com).

Most of these links might dead in the future, and for that case, you should use [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) or [archive.ph](https://archive.ph).
