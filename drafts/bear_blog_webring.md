# Bear Blog's Webring

[Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) (The website that this thing is hosting) is an awesome community of people sharing their opinions and life stories and cool things and all. But right now, there isn't something to connect the entire community together, so I made this webring to help people discover cool blogs and stuff on here.

If you want to get your blog featured on here, or to report a problem (like broken links), please [email me](mailto:mail@dht.anonaddy.me?subject=[Bear Blog Webring]).

If you are submitting your blog, please include the name of your blog in the subject line and the link to the blog + description in the Body of the email.
