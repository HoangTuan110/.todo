# A rant about file size formats

I wonder why the heck do we have stuff like kilobytes, kibibytes, which is similar in symbol (kB, KiB, respectively), and almost similar in size. A kilobyte = 1024 bytes, though sometimes it's 1000 bytes, for some reason, and a kibibyte = 1024 bytes all the time.

Why can't we just have a standard symbol for file size, so people no longer have to nitpick about a programming project uses the tagline `3 KB in size!` because they used the wrong symbol.
