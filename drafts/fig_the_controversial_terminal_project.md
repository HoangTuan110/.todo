# Fig: The controversial terminal project
Fig is a tool that adds auto-complete to your Mac terminal. Despite its simple goal, it is infamously known to be controversial, because of collecting de-anonymised user data, spamming emails, open-source (but doesn't, at the same time), and a whole lot of others.

In this post, I will go over through some of the reasons that makes Fig controversial.

# DISCLAIMER
Before listing the reasons, I want to add a disclaimer here:
All the reasons listed below are ONLY from testimonies of HN users and information from Fig's website (although most of information are from HN submissions). I am not a Mac user and have never used Fig before, so I can't prove if these are right or not. Read this with a grain of salt.

# 1. Collecting everything from your machine
One of Fig's sus behaviors is that they collect de-anomysied data from you. This is pointed out [multiple](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27278920) [times](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31223438) [by](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27283040) HN users.

While Fig allows users to [opt out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27277856) collecting data, I think this not being mentioned on their [privacy policy](https://fig.io/privacy) is one of its major red flags.

# 2. Fig ❤️ emails
As [pointed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27278920) [out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31223921) [by](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31223438) many people, Fig seems to have a passion with emails. It would bombarding your emails with feedback collections, spamming people's emails, and worst of all, you need to use the email to install and start using the app, which in my opinion, is questionable: Why would a company force you to give them your email so you can install their app?

# 3. Open-source, but proprietary
Fig claims itself as an open-source software, with a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete) to prove that. But [some](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31223921) [people](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31223048) have also pointed out that Fig is actually NOT open-source. However, I haven't find any solid point for this, so this seems less convincing than the other.

# 4. There are better alternatives
Many people have pointed out that Fig is [no](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31223118) [better](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31223452) than the auto-completion provided by many modern shells (e.g. zsh, fish, etc.). This one I can't say for sure, but from the video at their landing page, it seems that this is true.

> By the way, if you are looking for alternatives for this shit, I recommend checking out [hstr](https://github.com/dvorka/hstr), [fzf-tab](https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab), or [ble.sh](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh)

# 5. Interviewee abuse
Here's a [story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31223129) of someone who claims to be an interviewee at Fig and has a bad experience at the company. I cannot say if this is true, but if it is, it shows that Fig is not a very friendly company to work at.

# Conclusion
From all of the point above, it's safe to say that Fig is a questionable developer tool from a company that claims it to be "open-source".
