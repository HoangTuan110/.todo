# How I write

When writing for this blog, I stored all of my drafts and finished posts under a directory called `drafts` in the `.todo` directory. `.todo` is where I store my plain text writings (todos and drafts).

When writing a post, I use [Apostrophe](https://world.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/apostrophe/) (formally UberWriter) as my Markdown editor. It's an easy to use editor, with a smooth, beautiful UI.

For todos, I use the [`todo.txt`](http://todotxt.org/) format, and `todo.sh` for modifying my todos without editing the file directly.

I use Git to store all the changes inside my `.todo` folder, and also set up a alias to quickly commit without doing manually.

For storing images, I use [Catbox](https://catbox.moe). It's a 'weaboo' image hosting platform, but I honestly don't care. As long as it does what it needs to do, I will keep use it.

I take primary influence for my workflow from [Plaintext Productivity](https://plaintext-productivity.net/).
