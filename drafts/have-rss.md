# Have RSS Subscription (It's not dead yet)

RSS is a very old and boring technology, but that doesn't mean that it is dead.

It survives the test of time, just like with emails.

If possible, get RSS support for your blog.

If you are using Bear Blog (or the more popular WordPress), then they should have already support RSS at the domain:

```
https://yourblog.com/feed
```
