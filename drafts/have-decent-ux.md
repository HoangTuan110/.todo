# Have Decent UX

Your blog should have a decent UX.

I will summarize this in the 3 Ifs:

If it takes >= 3 seconds to load your blog,

If it isn't mobile-friendly and user-friendly,

If it looks like a bunch of hot mess,

Then expect your visitors to hit the `Back` button.

Luckily, If you are using [Bear](https://bearblog.dev/) (the blogging service that this site is hosting on), then it has already done all the job for you.
