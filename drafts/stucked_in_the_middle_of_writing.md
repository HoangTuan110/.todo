# Stucked in the middle of writing

A thing I noticed very common when I am writing is that when the flow is going well, suddenly it got stucked. I promptly lose the purpose to write the post, and when I tried to find it, I can't. It just vanished in the air.

A prime example is a post that I planned to release today. It is about how I feel exhausted after watching YouTube today, and when I am writing about why the new videos are unusual, I suddenly forget why I am exhausted. And then I forget the purpose to write the post, so I dumped it into the drafts and move on.

Can someone explain what this is? Why this is happening to me? And is there any way to cure it?
