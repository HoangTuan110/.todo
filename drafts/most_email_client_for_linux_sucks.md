# Most Email clients for Linux sucks

I have been trying to find an alternative to the evil Thunderbird (which has been known to [be insecure](https://digdeeper.neocities.org/images/efail-list.png) ([archive](https://archive.ph/5yKEa))), but almost all of the Email clients for Linux that I know out there has issues big enough for me to turn against it.

Claws Mail, one of the very first "Thunderbird alternative" that I used, requires you to fetch email manually, instead of automated like virtually any email client out there. Also, Claws Mail freezes a lot, and I have a problem trying to send an email with this thing.

Evolution looks very similar to Claws Mail, but worse, as you can't add another email account (or at least there's no obvious way to do it). Immediate no-no.

Geary looks nice, and even has an option to add another email account. But that feature never worked for me, so no.

Mailspring is quite a memory hog (consumed about 300-400 MB in startup). Other than that, it does well for its job.
