# Update Life #4

Hello there! Long time no blog.

Recently, I have been though a 9-day experience where we experienced through how a military soldier lives: The way they eat, bath, sleep, etc. I'm not going through the entire thing here, as I can spend the entire day talking about it, but just know that it was a fun experience and I feel like a caveman after getting back home and using my phone again (Yes, we wasn't allowed to use our phone or computer at there).

Also, my wound from [the bike ride](https://tsk.bearblog.dev/i-hurt-myself/) has completely healed. Now it's just a dot on my knee!

When I got back home and opened my phone, I saw 140+ emails and a lot of YouTube videos to binge. I read quite a lot of the emails, but eventually `Mark as read` all of them. And with the YouTube videos, I spent 2 days binging all of them.

Right now, I am feeling pretty going back to my usual schedule. Ready to do some programming. Oh, and watching YouTube, of course.

Btw, I only noticed Bear now has a massive upgrade in its Dashboard section, so I got a bit confused. But fortunately not for too long.
