# SEO Tips

These are SEO tips that I have learned over many months of learning about SEO online.

I have organized these tips into smaller blog posts (like with wikis).

I take a lot of advices here from [Backlinko](https://backlinko.com/), [The Definitive Guide To Growing Your Blog’s Audience 3x Faster](https://bloggingwizard.com/grow-your-audience/) ([archive](https://archive.ph/wip/T589B)), and [8 Reasons You’re Not Getting Any Website Traffic (And How To Fix It)](https://www.jeffbullas.com/not-getting-website-traffic/) ([archive](https://archive.ph/5R9lA)).

This blog post is a living post, as it will live and thrive as I learned more about SEO.
