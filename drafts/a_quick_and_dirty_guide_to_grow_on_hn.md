# A quick and dirty guide to grow your account on Hacker News (or any social media)

## 1. Be consistent

The first and most basic rule is to *be consistent*. Be active on HN for at least once every day. Found an interesting link? Submit it.

## 2. Be a good citizen

If you want to grow, you have to be a good citizen of the community.

Don't spam. Don't be a jerk. Don't waste your time (and others) arguing. Don't ask for clout.

Be nice. Help others. Do a little bit of something to help others who also saw that article, like commenting a archived web page link (in case the original link died or are locked behind a subscription).

## 3. Don't be spammy

This is derived from the point #2.

Like every other social media, Hacker News (and its users) doesn't like spams. Don't submit too fast, submit the same link over and over again, or submitting too many in a short amount of time. *Don't spam*.

## 4. Play the waiting game

Your submission will take about 1-7 hours to blow. Think of it hatching an egg. In those times, completely forget about the submission and go do what you normally do. I find submitting before going to sleep best, because you don't have to worry about it until the next day.

This is also what--I think--is the main difference between HN and other social medias. On, say, Twitter, when you tweet something, it will blow anyways, because people already know you and they have seen what you do. HN is different: You will have to compete with hundreds of thousands of other people doing the same thing, and most importantly, *you don't have an audience*. You are invincible.
