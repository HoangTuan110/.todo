# A quick and dirty guide to grow your account on Hacker News (or any social media)

I have grown my HN account from 49 to almost 3000, and today I will share you some of my advice for growing on Hacker News (or any social media in general).

## 1. Be consistent

The first and most basic rule is to *be consistent*. Be active on HN for at least once every day (If you are being addicted to your phone, try to turn off your WiFi or add a limit of 15 minutes). Found an interesting link? Submit it.

## 2. Be a good citizen

If you want to grow, you have to be a good citizen of the community.

Don't spam. Don't be a jerk. Don't waste your time (and others) arguing. Don't ask for clout.

Be nice. Help others. Do a little bit of something to help others who also saw that article, like commenting a archived web page link (in case the original link died or are locked behind a subscription).

## 3. Don't be spammy

This is derived from the point #2.

Like every other social media, Hacker News (and its users) doesn't like spams. Don't submit too fast, submit the same link over and over again, or submitting too many in a short amount of time.

## 4. Play the waiting game

Your submission will take about 1-7 hours to blow. Think of it hatching an egg. In those times, completely forget about the submission and go do what you normally do. I find submitting before going to sleep best, because you don't have to worry about it until the next day.

This is also what--I think--is the main difference between HN and other social medias. On, say, Twitter, when you tweet something, it will blow anyways, because people already know you and they have seen what you do. HN is different: You will have to compete with hundreds of thousands of other people doing the same thing, and most importantly, *you don't have an audience*. You are invincible.

## 5. Submit twice

When your submissions doesn't seem to do well, you can always submit it once more the next day if you think it deserves a blow.

When I first submit my two posts, [Programming Burnout](https://tsk.bearblog.dev/programming-burnout/) and [The Tools I use to write blogs](https://tsk.bearblog.dev/the-tools-i-use-to-write-blogs/), it didn't do well: Only gathering 2 points for a whole day. Then I tried to submit those two once again, and guess what? [Those](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31455657) [blowed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31432527).

Of course, you can resubmit as many times as you want, as long as the submission hasn't blowed up, but IMO, twice is enough.
