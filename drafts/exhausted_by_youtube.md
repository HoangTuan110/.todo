# Exhausted

After doing meditation, I decided to surf socials since that's what I always do when it's lunch. But for some reason, this time, it was much more exhausting.

I surfed [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and [Bear](https://bearblog.dev) as the first thing to do. These ones are not exhausting at all, since I can choose which one to read and when I wanted to stop. But when I opened YouTube however, the exhausting starts.

Right out of the gate, my notification says it has 11 (or 9+) new videos from those that I have subscribed. This is unusual since most of the time I only got 5-8 new videos/day, although I subscribed to 49 channels.

And just as unusually, the new videos bag today contains much longer videos: Beside the daily posting channels (I have 3 of them), there's 2 fat ass videos (20+ minutes each), and a lot of >10 minutes/almost 10 minutes videos.

> Fun fact: While counting the number of channels that I subscribed, I remove a few of them since they are no longer active or I don't like their content anymore. The real number would have been 52.
