# Webview gives better performance than normal browsers (when playing web games)

Today I learned that using Webview for playing web games gives better performance than using a browser.

I was trying to login into [TETR.IO](https://tetr.io), a modern Tetris implementation. I enter my username,
password, and a code stored in my Twilio Authy which serves as 2FA. Then, bam! I was greeted by a
disorientedly displayed "A-Lined" and a message telling me that I have been banned from the service.

When I first saw the message, I was dazed. I haven't log into my account for months, and in the time while
I was still playing the game, I have not used any cheat tools or played unfairly in any way, as I have no
intent to.

As an attempt to play the only interesting game in my tiny game library, I decided to open up the terminal
and visit an old project I hastily wrote about a month ago, called Weapp.
