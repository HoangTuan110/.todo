# My recommendation of privacy tools

After reading [this paragraph that makes fun of Privacy Guides for horrible privacy tool recommendations](https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/fake_initiatives.html#privacyguides), I decided to write my own recommendation of privacy tools and services.

> Note: I only recommend tools and services that I personally have used and trusted. There are some other software and services that I find trustworthy, which I will listed in the [Honorable mentions](#honorable-mentions) section.
