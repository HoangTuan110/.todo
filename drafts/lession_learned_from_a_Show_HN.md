# Lession learned from a Show HN

Yesterday, I decided to upload a Show HN submission. The thing that I show is [Lipu](https://lipu-flax.vercel.app), A Hacker News alternative interface.
At first, I didn't think of anything else. All things that I expected is some points and 1-2 comments about it, just like with my other submissions.
After all, Lipu is already pretty solid and flawless, right?

Turns out, I underestimated that.

Not even a day has passed, and I already have 9 points and 19 comments. The most I have ever have in my entire time on HN.
The fact that a Show HN about yet another HN alternative blows my mind.

This also happens to blow up my other social medias. Mostly on my [blog](https://tsk.bearblog.dev), which usually has >20 views at most, now has >50 views.

After this happened, I have learned a lot. I learned from the comments to make my HN alternative better, and I learned one important lesson:
Never underestimate a review. When people start reviewing your product and show how flawed it is, you will realized how much your ego has blinded
you.
