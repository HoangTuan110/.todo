# Pibby - The plain text social media platform (Idea)

Pibby is a microblogging platform that only uses plain text its user interface.

Users will post content using Markdown, and can use multimedia stuff, such as videos, images, emojis, etc.

But Pibby itself doesn't use anything other than plain text and links.

A normal user post on Pibby will look something like this:

```
+----------------------------------------------------+
|@tsukii                                 14:59 PM UTC|
|													 |
|  Welcome to Pibby!								 |
|													 |
|[Reply]							       [5 Toasts]|
+----------------------------------------------------+
```

And the Trending page will look something like this:

```
Trending
====================
<user post number 1>
<user post number 2>
<user post number 3>
...
<user post number 30>
```

And when the user is writing a blog post, it will look like this:

```
Write
====================
Content:
<HTML textarea box here>
[Submit] [Preview]
```

Pibby's character limit will be 1000 characters.
